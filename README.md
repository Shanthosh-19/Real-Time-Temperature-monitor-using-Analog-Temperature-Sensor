# Real-Time-Temperature-monitor-using-Analog-Temperature-Sensor
This system is employed with Analog NTC Thermistor Temperature Sensor, which measures temperature and displays it on LCD Display Controller.

This project is developed with C programming and one highlight feature is that, the Analog_Read() function is written by me instead of using the built-in analogread() function, which deepened my understanding of registers of ADC controller in Arduino Mega.
